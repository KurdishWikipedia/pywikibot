# Unofficial Pywikibot Scripts

This repository contains a collection of unofficial Pywikibot scripts, primarily developed for the [Central Kurdish Wikipedia](https://ckb.wikipedia.org). They are designed to automate repetitive editing tasks.

For the official framework, see the [Pywikibot manual on MediaWiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Pywikibot) or the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/wikimedia/pywikibot).

## Usage

These scripts are extensions and will not run on their own. They must be placed within a Pywikibot installation to function.

*   **Local Machine:** Move the script files into your `pywikibot-core/scripts/userscripts/` directory.
*   **Toolforge:** Store them in a separate folder (e.g., `$HOME/pywikibot-custom-scripts`) to protect them from being deleted during core updates from scratch.

Once placed correctly, you can run them like any other Pywikibot script.

## Disclaimer

**These scripts are unofficial and come with no warranty.** You are responsible for all edits performed. Always test thoroughly and ensure your bot's actions comply with all relevant Wikimedia policies.
